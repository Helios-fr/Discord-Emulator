# Discord-User-Scraper

**Summary Here**

## Usage:

### Setup

After downloading the project and extracting it install the required packages with:

&ensp;&ensp;`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then go to `token.txt` and replace everything in the file with your discord account token the method I recommend to get it is using [this tapermonkey extension](https://github.com/FOCI-DEV/Get-Discord-Token) make sure to remove the quotes around the token.

### Execution

After installing requirements run `main.py` and if you have followed the steps to set up correctly the program will ask for a server id and then a channel id use #general for the best results. Developer mode needs to be enabled to copy the id of the server and channel [help with that here](https://www.alphr.com/discord-find-server-id/).

## Errors

If you encounter an error be sure to check the following:

1. You have the token as the ONLY thing in token.txt and there aren't quotes around it.

2. You have installed the packages from requirements.txt

3. The server and channel id are correct.
